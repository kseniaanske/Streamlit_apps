## Virtual Environment
It is recommended that you create projects in their own virtual environments. You can do this using conda with these steps:

- create the environment with the name 'playground' with python=3.8.5
  - `conda create -y --name playground python=3.8.5`
- activate environment
  - `conda activate playground`
- complete "Instructions to Run" section

## Instructions to Run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
run command `streamlit run app.py`
